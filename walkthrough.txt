1. User enters frontend

2. They select a store => backend finds store, pulls employees and owners 

3. They select an employee => backend finds employee, pulls services, appointments, appointment timeslots

4. When they make an appointment:
  - Create timeslots for time needed for appointment with owner, employee
  - Create appointment with timeslots, service, owner, employee
  - Add appointment to timeslots 
  - Find employee to add that appointment._id to 
  - 

  Figure out what to hand to backend to make appointment time 

Each block on the frontend is in 30min intervals 
  12:30, 1:00, 1:30
When a service is selected, the service's timespan has a digit to indicates how many 30min blocks are needed 
  Cut and color: 3 blocks
This is decided when employee makes their service 30-3hr long 

On the backend, take the taken timeslot blocks and calculate the times based from that.
  If given 12:30 and 3 blocks => loop from 12:30 X blocks to create seperate time slots at 12:30, 1:00, 1:30 and push those timeslot._id onto an array 
Take that array and merge it into appointment


To test:
- Auth 
- multer + sharp working
- If store with owner check is working properly 

To work out:
- How to deal with timeslot calculation
  - Import Moment.js for that? On both ends?
